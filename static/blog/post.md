It was a Wednesday morning; I was 7 years old. The sun was shining and everything seemed to be going well. My brother and I were dressing up to go school. I loved school and reading about history and astronomy. Most importantly, I loved going to school because my friends were there and we could spend some time together. I was quiet but occasionally distractive in class. My brother couldn’t walk to school and so every day, we commuted by bike. This was actually the best part of my mornings. The air was full of oxygen and I could feel the breeze throughout my whole body. Folks were selling their goods and everybody seemed to be occupied by the beautiful sunrise. This was a particular day in Uvira. A day that I have not forgotten and still dear to my heart.

My brother and I arrived to school. He went to find his teacher and I followed my friend to my teacher. My friend Freddy Lukusa was extremely sharp and intelligent, perhaps the best futbol goalie in town. Our teacher never wanted to assign seats right next to each other, she knew we would talk and distract others. On that specific day in class, something seemed odd. We were missing a good amount of students. My friend Freddy asked me why our friends were absent, I joked and said that they were scared of the sprinting competition. See, we held these sprinting competitions and it was an accomplishment if completed. However, I knew something was going on. I overheard my father the day before talking about a possible conflict in our area. I didn’t take it too serious, we often heard those talks almost every month. Around noon, loud gunshots were heard from distance and classes were put on hold. That was the last time I would ever see Freddy Lukusa. That was the genesis of the second civil war in the Congo.

Uvira is a city in Sud Kivu. It is located at the north end of Lake Tanganyika and less than 80 km to Bujumbura, Burundi. Everything about my childhood begun there and some of my earliest role models were residents of Uvira. The city had its culture and was full of diversity. One of my favorite memories was Christmas. It was a religious feast in addition with the best celebration one can possibly imagine. The residents played songs everywhere, people danced nonstop and children ran around the neighborhood in harmony. My mother and the neighbors would spend the night cooking, singing and laughing. People were grateful and advocated for the idea of togetherness. Every Christmas day, I would spend the afternoon at Freddy’s home and he would come to my house in the evening and we would watch cartoons. The town was vibrant, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. This is the Uvira I knew and the Uvira I know now.

I refuse to allow the hardship of war to pervert my memories. Uvira will forever be my beautiful home.  I envision a Uvira where children are jubilant and mothers are not fearful of their families. Where children have the opportunities to go to school and are equipped with knowledge to reach their full potential in life. That’s why I am excited about Jimbere Fund’s work and I am helping out as much as I can. We have a responsibility to give back to a place we call home, especially when that place in so much need.
