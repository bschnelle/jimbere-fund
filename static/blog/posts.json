      "content": "<p>The development of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will take place when Women are part of the political system and given the same opportunities as men. This is not only true in the DRC but elsewhere. Women make up 53 percent of the Congolese population and 67 percent of the electorate. Yet, Women are barely present in the political system, in education and far less in the workforce. Jeffrey Sachs, a prominent political economist once said, ‚Äúa country that blocks women from fully participating in economic and political life is running on half its brain power and talents‚Äù.  For decades, women have been dehumanized by violence and kept in poverty by the system of oppression in the DRC. One particular way, DRC can make progress in development is changing its attitude towards young girls and allowing them to participate in education.</p>\n<p>In DRC, women are allowed to work and apply to various positions of their choice. However, opportunities are limited in comparison to men. This is particularly because of gender discrimination and the educational gap between woman and men. Women are underrepresented in the workforce and earn less than their male counter-parts in the same jobs. Furthermore, in many parts of the Congo, women are illegally denied pensions and the right of inherence. The presence of gender discrimination undermines the role of women in the society. These gender-based discriminations exist because of the lack of women in the political system and the limited opportunities in the DRC.</p>\n<p>The Congolese legislation protects women‚Äôs political rights under the law. Thus, women are given space to participate equally as men in the elections and run for local or national level political offices. Sadly, this is not manifested in provincial parliaments, and evidently the presence of women in the political system continues to be slim. A study conducted by Peacewomen showed that the proportion of female parliamentarians in Kinshasa was (17 %); followed by the southern province of Katanga (13 %). The Provinces with the least proportion of female parliamentarians were the Bas Congo (8 %), Kasa√Ø Occidental (7.5 %), Kasa√Ø Oriental (5 %), Equateur (5 %) and the eastern province of South Kivu (3 %). This is not a coincidence that the numbers are low. The educational attainment for women remains low and political careers are still perceived as men‚Äôs jobs. The culture must shift from gender-based sectors and establish a sagacity of freedom for women to choose what they want and dream big. Allow young girls to grow up and envision a future where they can be anything. Early marriages should become taboo and not normalized.</p>\n<p>In rural area, it is estimated that 74% of women between the age of 15 and 19 are married.  This is alarming! Not only do early marriages reinforce the poverty cycle, the lack of human capital increases. These women are exposed into sexual relationship at early age and become mothers as teenagers. Of course education is not the only key factor for change in the Congo. One must consider the history, culture and the current atmosphere of the Country. The country has been unstable for decades, the GDP per capita has been decreasing and the political arena has not been steady. The civil wars and civil unrests have made the country dangerous and women and children are eventual victims. The Congo is currently ranked among the most dangerous countries for women. The focus for peace must be an integral policy among Congolese people and their government.</p>\n<p>All Congolese should be against tribalism, xenophobia and gender-based discrimination. The country belongs to them and the fight for peace must be exemplified among themselves. The political economy of the country should be transparent and carefully designed for the benefit of the country and the people. Corruption must be fought at all levels and good governance must prevail. In addition, the government institutions should be accountable and the bureaucracy should be strengthened. The education system must be reengineered and customized to the present. The government should provide decent healthcare and educational opportunities, especially for young girls. The developmental progress of Congo will not take place until women are seen as equals, capable and vibrant members of the society. After all, Congolese women have been significantly contributing to the survival of their families and the whole DRC nation. Imagine what they can do if they are provided with the same opportunities as men in the peaceful Congo.</p>\n<p>\n    <em>Benjamin Itangishaka, originally from Sud Kivu in Democratic Republic of Congo, studied Political Science and Sociology at the University of Northern Colorado for undergraduate where he focused on multicultural social issues and politics in developing countries.

We'll be describing in detail how you would go about creating a React.js starter kit for building a single page application (SPA) from scratch.  We'll be using lots of different tools found in the React ecosystem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-whats-a-single-page-application-spa\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-a-single-page-application-spa\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>What's a Single Page Application (SPA)?</h4>\n\n<p>Traditionally web applications fetch a new HTML page anytime the user changes routes (e.g. <a href=\"https://benjaminschnelle.com\">https://benjaminschnelle.com</a> --&gt; <a href=\"https://benjaminschnelle.com/blog\">https://benjaminschnelle.com/blog</a>).  This creates a full page refresh which causes a flicker on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>With SPAs the page is only loaded once, then as you navigate around new data is fetched with JavaScript, asynchronously, and then the page is updated when the request completes.  The data fetching (think blog posts or user profile information) is typically done via an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</a> request to a remote server which sends the data back in some agreed upon format, <a href=\"http://www.json.org/\">JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a> being the most common these days.</p>\n\n<p>In general SPAs make for a better user experience as the application feels more <em>native</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-tools\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#tools\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Tools</h4>\n\n<p>We'll be using a <em>lot</em> of different libraries and frameworks to compose our starter kit.

The <code>\\n</code> is a new line (the same as pressing enter/return at the end of a sentence).  It just tells Git to ignore those directories when tracking files.</li>\n<li>Initialize Git in the current directory.</li>\n<li>Stage all files (excluding those in our \".gitignore\" file) so that they can be committed.</li>\n<li>Commit all of our staged files...described above.</li>\n<li>Set our remote repository to the one we just created on GitHub.  This is where we're going to push our local repo to.  That way if we spill water on our laptop or want to share the repo with someone else it can just be cloned/downloaded from GitHub.</li>\n<li>Push our local repository to the master branch on GitHub and set the upstream repository to our GitHub repo.  You'll be prompted for your GitHub credentials when this command is run.\n\n<ul>\n<li>When typing in your password it doesn't look like you're typing anything, but you actually are!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-running-into-issues\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#running-into-issues\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Running into issues?</h4>\n\n<p>WARNING: the command below will delete <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> in the directory you target so be <em>careful</em>!</p>\n\n<p>If you think something got messed up and want to start all over with the Git process (from <code>git init</code>) run <code>rm -rf .git</code> from your project directory.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should now be able to refresh the repo on GitHub and see your local project's files!</p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-project-management\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-management\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Project Management</h4>\n\n<p>GitHub has some nice tools that make managing a project easier.  You can create milestones as longer term goals and then add issues to your milestone as \"todo\" items.  Once all your issues have been completed your milestone can be considered complete and closed out.</p>\n\n<p>From your repository on GitHub click the \"Issues\" tab and you should see a \"Milestones\" button as shown below.

Create a new milestone with a title of \"0.1.0 - Initial Release\" which is going to be our first release of the starter kit.  If you want to give it a due date you can do that as well.</p>\n\n<p>Once you've created the milestone, you should be redirected to a page listing all your project milestones.  Click the milestone title which will take you to that milestone's homepage where it will inform you that there are currently no issues assigned to the milestone.

On the right will be the \"New Issue\" button again.  Create new issues for all of the items in the list below, but make sure you add the \"0.1.0 - Initial Release\" milestone to each one - there is an option to do so on the righthand side of the issue creation screen.</p>\n\n<h5>\n<a id=\"user-content-issues\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#issues\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Issues</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Setup ESLint</li>\n<li>Configure Webpack for development</li>\n<li>Configure Webpack for production</li>\n<li>React and React Router</li>\n<li>Testing setup</li>\n<li>Redux</li>\n<li>Immutable.js</li>\n<li>Misc development tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you're finished return to the overview screen for our new milestone.

Initialize Node Package Manager (NPM)</h2>\n\n<p>NPM is <em>the</em> JavaScript package manager.  What's a package manager?  It's a way for people to package up code and share it with others.  Thousands of individuals and organizations give away their hard work everyday to help others solve their problems more easily.  This is known as <em>open source</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We'll use NPM to download packages (from the terminal) for various reasons during our time together.  So how do we get NPM?  We install Node.js which comes with NPM!  So cruise over to the <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/download/\">Node</a> site and follow the download/installation instructions.</p>\n\n<p>All done?  Awesome.</p>\n\n<p>Let's install stuff!  Wait, how do we do that?  Well first we need to initialize our project with NPM so that we can use it to manage our dependencies.  Run the command below.  It'll ask you a bunch of questions to which you can either accept the default (by pressing enter) or provide your own values.  If you screw something up, don't worry.  You can change all of the values afterwards.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>npm init</pre></div>\n\n<p>This command will generate a \"package.json\" file in the root of our project containing our answers to the questions asked and some other stuff.  This file is magical.  It is how we'll manage all of our dependencies.  You can either edit it manually or the NPM command line interface (CLI) will edit it for you when you run certain commands.

There aren't really any downsides to committing frequently and doing so gives you more flexibility if you need to rollback for any reason.  Also, smaller changes make it easier for others to follow when trying to get up to speed on your project.  </p>\n\n<p>Remember our GitHub issues we need to knock out to reach our first 0.1.0 milestone?  We get to close one!  You can automatically close issues using keywords (close, fix, resolve) in your commit messages.  </p>\n\n<p>Assuming you created your issues in the same order as the list above and didn't delete/recreate any our issue numbers should match, but double check them just in case.  You can get the issue number by visiting the issue page on GitHub.</p>\n\n<p>Go ahead and run the commands below to commit your changes and automatically close issue #1 on GitHub.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>git add <span class=\"pl-c1\">.</span> <span class=\"pl-c\">## a period is a shortcut for --all</span>\ngit commit -m <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>initialized NPM...closes #1<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>\ngit push origin master</pre></div>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bschnelle/react-starter-kit/tree/571c7e0e1697d678bcbd4e61382c9f26612c8fab\">My repo after this commit</a></p>\n\n<p>If you go back to the overview of your milestone on GitHub you should see that issue #1 has been closed and you have a little bit of progress on your milestone! <g-emoji alias=\"smiley\" fallback-src=\"https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f603.png\">üòÉ</g-emoji></p>\n\n<h2>\n<a id=\"user-content-4-setup-eslint\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#4-setup-eslint\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>4. Setup ESLint</h2>\n\n<p>If you're unfamiliar with hinting/linting it's just the idea of following certain conventions when writing code so that things are standardized and good practices are followed.  It's especially helpful when working on a team of developers so that you don't run into a scenario where one person is using tabs to indent and another is using spaces (for example).  Consistency good, inconsistency bad.</p>\n\n<p>ESLint makes it easy for us to enforce those rules.  ESLint + Atom makes it easy to get <em>realtime</em> feedback right in our editor.  There are many preconfigured sets of rules available for ESLint and Airbnb provides a pretty good one so we'll use that.  If you/me/we decide we want to change something later we can do that also!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-side-note-on-npm\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#side-note-on-npm\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Side note on NPM</h4>\n\n<p>NPM packages can be saved in multiple ways, but the two we're concerned with are as <code>devDependencies</code> (development) or <code>dependencies</code> (production) with the <code>--save-dev</code> and <code>--save</code> arguments, respectively.  </p>\n\n<p>NPM was originally intended to be a server side development tool (for Node), but is now widely used for client side development and the use cases between the two are a little different.  In the case of server development one should be able to clone the repository from GitHub (or wherever) and run <code>NODE_ENV=production npm install</code> (NODE_ENV is a common <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable\">environment variable</a> used in Node to dictate how things should behave) which will only install those packages defined in the <code>dependencies</code> section of \"package.json\" then run the application.  </p>\n\n<p>In the case of a client app it is a little different.  Here, we should be able to clone the repository, run the same installation command with NODE_ENV set to \"production\", bundle our application (as we'll describe later using Webpack), and finally deploy it.</p>\n\n<p>It is easy to view the bundling step as a development concern so intuitively it makes sense to put those packages in <code>devDependencies</code>, but if we did that we wouldn't be able to bundle our app successfully when having NODE_ENV set to \"production\".  Therefore, if you see things being installed with <code>--save</code> when you think <code>--save-dev</code> makes more sense, it is likely for this reason.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let's go ahead and get ESLint from our handy friend NPM in addition to some other related dependencies.  The commands a little further down, which as suggested by the <code>eslint-config-airbnb</code> installation page, will get the package's <code>peerDependencies</code> then pipe them through some regex and install all of them in addition to the package itself.  Finally, we also need to install <code>babel-eslint</code> in order to properly lint certain ES6/ES7 features like class properties.</p>\n\n<h5>\n<a id=\"user-content-new-terms\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#new-terms\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>New Terms</h5>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<code>peerDependencies</code>: a way for a package to tell <em>your</em> project (the parent) that it needs another package in order to work, but that package is <em>not</em> automatically installed.  Therefore if you don't include it in your project's <code>dependencies</code> NPM will throw a warning and the package you installed probably won't work correctly.</li>\n<li>RegEx: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp\">regular expressions</a> are a way to match strings</li>\n<li>ES6/ES7: JavaScript (ES = ECMAScript = JavaScript) is always being improved upon and the improvements are only defined in a specification and the implementation of features is left up to the community.  That means all of the individual browsers and Node.js need implement any new features on their own.  This is why you'll often run into situations where a feature will be supported in one browser, but not another.  ES6 and ES7 are the two newest versions of JavaScript.  Because neither of them have wide support yet we transpile it into ES5 (with Babel) so that we can be reasonably confident it will run in most people's browsers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> PKG=eslint-config-airbnb<span class=\"pl-k\">;</span>\nnpm info <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">$PKG</span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span> peerDependencies --json \\\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">command</span> sed <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>s/[\\{\\},]//g ; s/: /@/g<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span> \\\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">|</span> xargs npm install --save-dev <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">$PKG</span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\nnpm install --save-dev babel-eslint</pre></div>\n\n<h5>\n<a id=\"user-content-whats-going-on-here\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#whats-going-on-here\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>What's going on here?</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>put eslint-config-airbnb in a variable named PKG</li>\n<li>install eslint-config-airbnb and its peerDependencies\n\n<ul>\n<li>return the peerDependencies of eslint-config-airbnb as JSON</li>\n<li>convert each of the peerDependencies to an installable string format</li>\n<li>install each of the peerDependencies</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>install babel-eslint</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you take a look at your <code>package.json</code> file now, there should be a new section called <code>devDependencies</code> similar to the one below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\"><pre>{\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>babel-eslint<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>^6.1.2<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>eslint<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>^3.3.1<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>eslint-config-airbnb<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>^10.0.1<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>eslint-plugin-import<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>^1.13.0<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>^2.1.0<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n  <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>eslint-plugin-react<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>^6.1.2<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n}</pre></div>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-youve-been-working-hard-heres-a-cat-gif\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#youve-been-working-hard-heres-a-cat-gif\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>You've been working hard, here's a cat GIF</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/167124a30961dd6b77a0310990e901d7963c53c3/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f61546d6a6153702e676966\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/167124a30961dd6b77a0310990e901d7963c53c3/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f61546d6a6153702e676966\" alt=\"Cat GIF\" data-canonical-src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aTmjaSp.gif\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n\n<h4>\n<a id=\"user-content-configuration\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#configuration\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Configuration</h4>\n\n<p>Now that we have our packages installed we need to tell ESLint to use the Airbnb rules when linting.

It has its own package manager to install plugins for the editor to add all sorts of functionality.  ESLint is one of those packages.

To get the ESLint plugin run the command below.</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell\"><pre>apm install linter-eslint</pre></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you receive an <code>apm: command not found</code> error, open up Atom then click <em>Atom &gt; Install Shell Commands</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That was eerily similar to how we install NPM packages.

Running <code>npm run lint</code> will return the same errors as well (you may get a deprecation warning about react/require-extension that you can safely ignore).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you aren't getting an error in Atom click <em>Atom &gt; Preferences</em> which should open up a new tab.  Click the <em>Packages</em> link on the lefthand side of the tab, then search for \"linter-eslint\" and disable/reenable the package.
